MMITS extends many commonly used data formats such as time-series and transactions to allow multi-variate data, non-uniform sampling, non-aligned sampling, and hierarchically-structured data. In that, MMITSs are particularly well suited to represent classical time-series, but also transactions, logs, sparse events, asynchronous measurements, and hierarchical records.\n",
