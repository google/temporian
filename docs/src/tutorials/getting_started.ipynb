    "#### Feature naming\n",

    "As you can see, the first moving average operation didn't change the feature name `signal` from the input, so `trend[\"signal\"]` is the only output feature at that point. However, after the subtract operation, the resulting feature name is `sub_signal_signal`, which seems kinda weird in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, the naming criteria is not complicated, there are 2 rules:\n",
    "- If the operator expects one single input (e.g: `simple_moving_average`), the output is a new `EventSet` with the same feature names as the only input.\n",
    "- If the operator involves two inputs (e.g: arithmetics like `+-*/`), the output names are created by joining together the input feature names. For example, adding `evset[[\"f1\", \"f2\"]] + evset[[\"f3\", \"f4\"]]` results in a new `EventSet` with two features: `[\"add_f1_f3\", \"add_f2_f4\"]`. Note that features are always added together by position, not by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "So this name `sub_signal_signal` is the result of subtracting a feature named `signal` from another feature with the same name. We could have renamed the `trend[\"signal\"]` feature to something better, to avoid this duplication. Let's do it now.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You now have the basic concepts needed to create a data preprocessing pipeline with Temporian:\n",
    "- Defining an **EventSet** and using **operators** on it.\n",
    "- Combine **features** using **select** and **glue**.\n",
    "- Converting data back and forth between Temporian's **EventSet** and pandas **DataFrames**.\n",
    "- Visualizing input/output data using **EventSet.plot()**.\n",
    "- Using an **index** to separate signals in the graph operations and plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Missing and Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "There are important things we could not include in this introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this example we used a signal with uniform sampling (equal distance between event timestamps), but Temporian can handle non-uniform data just as easily. Read more about the data representation on the **[User Guide's introduction](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/)**.\n",
    "- Temporian is **strict on the feature types** when applying operations, to avoid potentially silent errors or memory issues. For example, you cannot perform binary operations (e.g: arithmetics or comparisons) between features with different types. Check the [User Guide's **casting** section](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#casting) section to learn how to tackle those cases.\n",
    "- In this case, we only used seconds as the timestamps of the signal, but you might as well use calendar dates. Learn more about it on the [**Time Units** section of the User Guide](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#time-units). After reading that section, check that there are many [**calendar operators**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/temporian/operators/calendar/calendar_day_of_month/) available when working with date timestamps.\n",
    "- If you need to manipulate the timestamp of events, check the [User Guide's **sampling** section](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#sampling) to learn more about this.\n",
    "- We only used moving average here, but there are a bunch of other [**moving window**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/temporian/operators/window/moving_count/) operators, frequently useful for time sequences manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always keep in mind these resources:\n",
    "- Try the more advanced [**tutorials**](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/) to continue learning by example about all these topics and more!\n",
    "- We could only cover a small fraction of **[all available operators](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/temporian/operators/add_index/)**.\n",
    "- We put a lot of ❤️ in the **[User Guide](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/)**, so make sure to check it out 🙂."
