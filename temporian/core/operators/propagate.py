    """Extends index and propagates feature values.

    Extends the index of `event` over the features of `add_event`. Feature
    values from `event` are duplicated over the new index. `add_event` can be a
    string or list of string representing features in `event`, or an event.

    For example, suppose an index-less event sequence containing two features
    "f_1" and "f_2", and containing 16 timestamps. Suppose "f_1" is a numerical
    feature and "f_2" is a string feature with 4 unique values across the 16
    timestamps. "Propagating" feature "f_1" over "f_2" will create an event
    sequence containing feature "f_1" and indexed by feature "f_2". This event
    sequence will contain 4 indexed time sequences each containing 16
    timestamps.

    Example:

    If `event` is indexed by ["x"] and contain two features "f1" and "f2", and
    if `add_event` is also indexed by ["x"] and contains two features "y" and
    "z", the result is an event indexed by ["x", "y", "z"] and containing
    features "f1" and "f2".

    Constraints:

    - If `to` is an event, `event` and `to` have the same index
      and same sampling.

    Args:
        event: The event to propagate.
        to: The features to index over. If `to` is a list of
          strings, those strings should refer to existing features of `event`.

    Returns:
        An event sequence propagated over `to`.
