"""A duration in seconds, stored as a float64.

In Temporian, timestamps and durations are float64 values, and it is up to the
user to choose the semantic of this value.

However, some functions are datetime-related (such as the functions defined in
this module, calendar operators, plotting functions, and more) and assume that
durations are expressed in seconds (see
[Time units](https://temporian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/#time-units)),
so it is recommended to use seconds as timestamps where possible.
